    "`Keras` is a Deep Learning framework for Python.  As with all deep learning, it uses neural networks.  The applications are as vast as `TensorFlow`, and it is capable of running on top of `TensorFlow`, `CNTK`, or `Theano`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Keras` includes very high-level functions, meaning less required code than `TensorFlow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core data structure is a `model`, and it organizes the layers.\n",
    "The `Sequential` model is the simplest model, consisting of a linear stack of layers.  The `Keras` functional API allows construction of arbitrary graphs of layers.  Complex architectures are supported including `LSTM` and `CNNs`.\n",
